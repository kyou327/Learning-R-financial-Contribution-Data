# Using R to analyze 2020 Financial Contribution Data in Oregon

This project completes the objectives for the R programming module of the Udacity Nanodegree.

By analyzing tables of financial contribution data for the state of Oregon in the 2020 election, we get a clear picture of who the primary
donors to political campaigns were, and the demographics that define them.

Using RStudio, the data is plotted to make it more easily readable.

Analysis included Univariate plots, Bivariate plots, and Multivariate plots to identify trends and relationships between the data.

Final knitted HTML file of the plots and analysis are contained in the file 2020financialcontrib_OR.html
